    <h2>What is Investing?</h2>
    <p>Investing means allocating money with the expectation of generating profit or income. Unlike saving, investing involves calculated risks to grow your wealth over time.</p>
    
    <div class="concept-card">
        <h3>Why Invest?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beat inflation:</strong> Cash loses value (3-7% annually in Kenya)</li>
            <li><strong>Wealth building:</strong> Compound growth over time</li>
            <li><strong>Passive income:</strong> Dividends/rental income</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Main Ways to Invest</h3>
    <div class="concept-grid">
        <div class="concept-card">
            <h4>1. Stocks (Equities)</h4>
            <p>Buying shares of companies like Safaricom, KCB</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> 100 Safaricom shares @ KSh 20 = KSh 2,000 investment</p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Expected Returns Comparison:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stocks:</strong> Average annual return for stocks in Kenya is typically 10-15%. For example, if you invest KSh 2,000 in Safaricom shares and the price grows by 12% in a year, your investment becomes KSh 2,240.
                        <br>
                        <em>Calculation:</em> KSh 2,000 × 1.12 = KSh 2,240
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Real Estate:</strong> Rental properties in Nairobi can yield 8-12% per year plus property value appreciation. For instance, a KSh 5,000,000 apartment rented at KSh 40,000/month earns KSh 480,000/year (9.6% yield).
                        <br>
                        <em>Calculation:</em> (KSh 40,000 × 12) / KSh 5,000,000 × 100% = 9.6%
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bonds:</strong> Government bonds pay 7-12% annually. A KSh 10,000 bond at 10% earns KSh 1,000 interest per year.
                        <br>
                        <em>Calculation:</em> KSh 10,000 × 0.10 = KSh 1,000
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Banks (Savings Account):</strong> Most Kenyan banks offer 4% annual interest. If you save KSh 10,000, after one year you get KSh 10,400.
                        <br>
                        <em>Calculation:</em> KSh 10,000 × 1.04 = KSh 10,400
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>Why Not Just Save in a Bank?</h4>
                <p>
                    While banks offer safety and liquidity, the average savings account yields only about 4% per year. This is often less than the rate of inflation (typically 6-8% in Kenya), meaning your money loses purchasing power over time.
                </p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Example:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You save KSh 10,000 in a bank at 4% interest. After one year, you have KSh 10,400.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If inflation is 7%, your money's real value is KSh 10,400 / 1.07 ≈ KSh 9,720 (less than you started with).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            By investing in stocks, bonds, or real estate, you can earn higher returns (8-15%+), outpacing inflation and growing your wealth.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Allocating money to investments rather than just saving in a bank helps you beat inflation, build wealth, and achieve financial goals faster.

            <h4>2. Real Estate</h4>
            <p>Physical properties or REITs</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Buying a rental apartment in Nairobi</p>
            <p><strong>Expected Return:</strong> Real estate in Nairobi typically yields 8-12% annually from rental income, plus property value appreciation. For example, a KSh 5,000,000 apartment rented at KSh 40,000/month earns KSh 480,000/year (9.6% yield).</p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Calculation:</strong> (KSh 40,000 × 12) / KSh 5,000,000 × 100% = 9.6% annual yield
            </div>
            <p><strong>Why Not Just Save in a Bank?</strong> Most Kenyan banks offer about 4% annual interest. If you save KSh 5,000,000, after one year you get KSh 5,200,000. But if inflation is 7%, your real value is KSh 5,200,000 / 1.07 ≈ KSh 4,859,813—less than you started with.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bank savings: KSh 5,000,000 × 1.04 = KSh 5,200,000 after one year</li>
                    <li>Inflation adjustment: KSh 5,200,000 / 1.07 ≈ KSh 4,859,813 (real value)</li>
                    <li>Real estate: Earn KSh 480,000 rent + property appreciation, outpacing inflation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Allocating money to real estate can provide higher returns and protect against inflation, while bank savings may lose value in real terms.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="concept-card">
            <h4>3. Bonds</h4>
            <p>Loaning to governments/companies</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Kenya Eurobond paying 7% annually</p>
            <p>Bonds are fixed-income investments where you lend money to governments or companies in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of your principal at maturity.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Buy a Kenya government bond for KSh 10,000 at 10% annual interest. You receive KSh 1,000 interest each year, plus your KSh 10,000 back at the end of the term.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Expected Return:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Government Bonds:</strong> Typically pay 7-12% per year. For example, a KSh 10,000 bond at 10% earns KSh 1,000 interest annually.
                        <br>
                        <em>Calculation:</em> KSh 10,000 × 0.10 = KSh 1,000

                    <li>
                        <strong>Corporate Bonds:</strong> May pay higher rates (up to 15%) but carry more risk.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Yield Curve:</strong> Shows interest rates for bonds of different maturities. A rising curve means higher long-term rates (good for investors), while an inverted curve can signal economic trouble.
                        <div class="example-box">
                            <strong>Example:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Kenya 2-year bond: 8% yield</li>
                                <li>Kenya 10-year bond: 12% yield</li>
                                <li>Steep curve = higher returns for longer-term bonds</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Risks:</strong> Bonds are safer than stocks but can lose value if interest rates rise (bond prices fall), or if the issuer defaults.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Liquidity:</strong> Some bonds can be sold before maturity, but prices may fluctuate.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>How Bonds Improve Your Portfolio:</strong> Bonds provide steady income, reduce risk, and balance out stock market volatility. They are ideal for conservative investors or those seeking predictable returns.

                        <strong>Company Concept (Detailed):</strong> When you invest in a company by buying its shares, you become a part-owner. This ownership comes with several benefits and responsibilities:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Profit Sharing:</strong> As a shareholder, you are entitled to a portion of the company's profits, usually paid out as dividends. For example, if Safaricom performs well and declares a dividend, you receive a payment based on the number of shares you own.
                            <div class="example-box">
                                <strong>Example:</strong> Safaricom announces a KSh 1.10 dividend per share. If you own 2,000 shares, you receive KSh 2,200.
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Share Price Growth:</strong> If the company grows and becomes more profitable, its share price may rise. You can sell your shares at a higher price for a capital gain.
                            <div class="example-box">
                                <strong>Example:</strong> Buy 500 KCB shares at KSh 40, sell at KSh 60 &rarr; profit = 500 × (60 - 40) = KSh 10,000.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Voting Rights:</strong> Many companies allow shareholders to vote on important matters, such as electing board members or approving mergers. This gives you a say in the company's future direction.
                            <div class="example-box">
                                <strong>Example:</strong> Attend Safaricom’s annual general meeting and vote on key decisions as a shareholder.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Risks:</strong> If the company performs poorly, share prices may fall and dividends can be reduced or suspended. You could lose part or all of your investment.
                            <div class="example-box">
                                <strong>Example:</strong> If a company reports losses, its stock price may drop and you could lose part of your investment.

                    <p>
                        <strong>What to Expect:</strong> As a shareholder, you benefit when the company succeeds, but you also share in its risks. Watch for earnings reports, dividend announcements, and major company news—they can all impact your returns. Be prepared for both growth opportunities and potential setbacks.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Company Concept:</strong> When you invest in stocks, you become a partial owner of a company. This means you share in its profits (through dividends), growth (as the share price rises), and sometimes its decision-making (voting rights at annual meetings).

                        <li>
                            <strong>Dividends:</strong> Many companies pay out a portion of their profits to shareholders. For example, Safaricom pays annual dividends to investors, providing a steady income stream.
                            <div class="example-box">
                                <strong>Example:</strong> If you own 1,000 Safaricom shares and the company declares a KSh 1.10 dividend per share, you receive KSh 1,100.

                            <strong>Share Price Appreciation:</strong> As the company grows and becomes more profitable, its share price may increase. Investors can sell shares at a higher price for capital gains.

                    <h4>P/E Ratio</h4>
                    <p>Price-to-Earnings ratio shows how much investors pay per shilling of earnings</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Safaricom P/E ~20 means investors pay KSh 20 for KSh 1 of earnings</p>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>P/E Ratio</strong> (Price-to-Earnings Ratio) is a key metric used to evaluate how much investors are willing to pay for each shilling of a company's earnings. It helps you compare whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to its peers or its own historical average.

                            <strong>Low P/E (e.g., below 10):</strong> May indicate the stock is undervalued, or the company is facing challenges.
                            <div class="example-box">
                                <strong>Example:</strong> If KCB Bank has a P/E of 8, it could be a bargain if the company is stable and growing.

                            <strong>High P/E (e.g., above 25):</strong> May suggest the stock is overvalued, or investors expect high future growth.
                            <div class="example-box">
                                <strong>Example:</strong> Safaricom with a P/E of 30 means investors expect strong future earnings growth.

                            <strong>Comparing P/E Ratios:</strong> Always compare a company's P/E to its industry average and historical levels.

                                <strong>Example:</strong> If Safaricom's P/E is 20 and the telecom sector average is 15, Safaricom is trading at a premium.

                        <strong>What to expect:</strong> Companies with low P/E ratios may attract value investors looking for bargains, while high P/E stocks often appeal to growth investors. Watch for changes in earnings reports, sector trends, and economic conditions that can affect P/E ratios.

                    <p>
                        The <strong>Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio</strong> compares a company's market value (share price × shares outstanding) to its book value (net assets on the balance sheet). It helps investors assess whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its actual assets.

                                <strong>Example:</strong> If KCB Bank has a P/B of 0.8, its shares trade below the value of its assets—could be a bargain if assets are reliable.

                        <strong>What to expect:</strong> Companies with low P/B ratios may attract value investors, especially if assets are strong and earnings are stable.

                            <strong>Low ROE (e.g., below 8%):</strong> May signal weak profitability or inefficient use of capital.
                            <div class="example-box">
                                <strong>Example:</strong> If a company earns KSh 5 billion net income on KSh 100 billion equity, ROE = 5%.
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Comparing ROE:</strong> Always compare to industry averages and consider how much debt the company uses (high debt can artificially boost ROE).
                            <div class="example-box">
                                <strong>Example:</strong> Safaricom has ROE of 30%, telecom sector average is 18%—Safaricom is highly efficient.
                            </div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What to expect:</strong> Companies with consistently high ROE are often market leaders and attract growth investors. Watch for changes in net income, equity levels, and debt that can affect ROE. Sudden drops may signal operational issues or increased competition.

        <div class="concept-grid">
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>Market Capitalization</h4>
                <p>Total value of a company's outstanding shares. Indicates company size and investor confidence.</p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Safaricom has 40 billion shares outstanding, trading at KSh 20 each.<br>
                    Market Cap = 40,000,000,000 × KSh 20 = KSh 800,000,000,000.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Large-cap companies are usually more stable, while small-cap stocks may offer higher growth but more risk.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>Dividend Yield</h4>
                <p>Shows how much a company pays out in dividends relative to its share price.</p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Safaricom pays KSh 1.10 dividend per share, share price is KSh 20.<br>
                    Dividend Yield = (1.10 / 20) × 100% = 5.5%
                </div>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Higher yields attract income-focused investors. Compare yields across companies and sectors.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>Debt-to-Equity Ratio</h4>
                <p>Measures company leverage. Ratio of total debt to shareholder equity.</p>

                    Debt-to-Equity = 200B / 100B = 2.0
                </div>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> High ratios mean more risk if earnings fall. Low ratios indicate conservative financing.</p>

                    EPS = 80B / 40B = KSh 2.00 per share.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Rising EPS signals growing profits. Compare EPS growth over time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">

                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Safaricom generates KSh 10B operating cash, spends KSh 3B on capital expenses.<br>
                    Free Cash Flow = 10B - 3B = KSh 7B.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Positive free cash flow means financial flexibility and stability.</p>
            </div>

                </div>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Good governance reduces risk of fraud and mismanagement.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>Sector & Industry Trends</h4>
                <p>Company performance is affected by sector growth, competition, and regulation.</p>

                </div>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Always consider broader industry trends when evaluating a company.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>Corporate Actions</h4>
                <p>Events like stock splits, buybacks, mergers, and acquisitions can impact share price and investor returns.</p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Example:</strong> KCB Bank announces a share buyback, reducing shares outstanding and potentially increasing EPS.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Corporate actions can signal management confidence or strategic changes.</p>

            <p>Complete guide to currency trading and macroeconomic factors.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>What is Forex?</h3>
            <p>Forex (foreign exchange) is the largest financial market where currencies are traded. It operates 24/5 and involves buying one currency while selling another.</p>
            <p>Major players include banks, corporations, and retail traders.</p>
            <p>The goal of trading is to make money based on the constant moving market</p>
            <p>You are always aiming to buy low(cheap/oversold/undervalued) and sell high(expensive/overbought/overvalued)</p>
            
            <h3>Major Currency Pairs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>EUR/USD (Euro vs. US Dollar)</li>
                <li>USD/JPY (US Dollar vs. Japanese Yen)</li>
                <li>GBP/USD (British Pound vs. US Dollar)</li>
                <li>USD/CHF (US Dollar vs. Swiss Franc)</li>
                <li>USD/ZAR (US Dollar vs. South African Rand)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Key Forex Concepts</h3>
            <div class="concept-grid">
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Pips</h4>
                    <p>Smallest price move (0.0001 for most pairs)</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> EUR/USD moves from 1.1000 to 1.1001 = 1 pip</p>
                    <p>1 pip on a standard lot is equivalent to 10$ on many major pair's </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Leverage</h4>
                    <p>Borrowed capital to increase position size (e.g., 1:100 leverage means $1 controls $100)</p>
                    <p>Levarage allows you to control huge positions but is also risky and may lead to massive losses if misused </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Spread</h4>
                    <p>Difference between buy and sell prices (broker's commission)</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> EUR/USD bid 1.1000, ask 1.1002 = 2 pip spread</p>
                    <p>Spread is the cost of trading and can vary based on market conditions</p>

                </div>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Margin</h4>
                    <p>Amount required to open a leveraged position (e.g., 1% margin means $1,000 controls $100,000)</p>
                    <p>Margin is the amount of money you need to deposit to open a position</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Lot Sizes</h4>
                    <p>Standard lot (100,000 units), mini lot (10,000), micro lot (1,000)</p>
                    <p>Lot size determines position size and risk exposure</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Order Types</h4>
                    <p>Market orders, limit orders, stop-loss orders(SL), take-profit orders(TP)</p>
                    <p>Order types help you control entry/exit points and risk management</p>
                    <p>Market orders are executed instantly at the best available price while limit ordrs are set to be executed while price reaches a certain price point</p>
                    <p>Stop-loss orders automatically close a position at a specified loss level to limit risk if price moves against you</p>
                    <p>TP and Sl are perfect examples of limit order's you wanna exit at a specific set price</p>
                    <p>take profit orders automatically closes your position at a specific set profit level when price moves in your direction</p>
                    <p>Example: If you buy EUR/USD at 1.1000 and set a SL at 1.0950, your position will close automatically if the price drops to 1.0950</p>
                    <p>Example: If you buy EUR/USD at 1.1000 and set a TP at 1.1050, your position will close automatically when the price reaches 1.1050</p>
                </div>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Swap/Rollover</h4>
                    <p>Interest paid or earned for holding a forex position overnight, based on the difference in interest rates between two currencies.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you buy EUR/USD and the euro has a higher interest rate than the dollar, you may earn a positive swap. If the dollar rate is higher, you pay a negative swap.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Swap Calculation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Buy EUR/USD, hold overnight: Broker credits or debits your account based on rate differential.</li>
                            <li>Swap rates vary by broker and currency pair.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Slippage</h4>
                    <p>Difference between expected price and actual execution price, often during high volatility or low liquidity.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Place a buy order at 1.1000, but trade executes at 1.1003 due to fast-moving market—slippage of 3 pips.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Requotes</h4>
                    <p>Broker offers a new price if the requested price is unavailable, common in fast markets.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Try to buy EUR/USD at 1.1000, but price moves to 1.1005—broker requotes at new price.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Stop Hunting</h4>
                    <p>Market moves to trigger stop-loss orders before reversing, often caused by large players seeking liquidity.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>EUR/USD drops below support, triggers stops, then quickly reverses upward.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Liquidity</h4>
                    <p>Ease of buying/selling without affecting price. Major pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD) have high liquidity; exotic pairs have lower liquidity and wider spreads.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>EUR/USD trades billions daily—tight spreads, fast execution.</li>
                            <li>USD/KES has lower liquidity—wider spreads, possible slippage.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Correlation</h4>
                    <p>How currency pairs move in relation to each other. Positive correlation means pairs move together; negative means they move opposite.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>EUR/USD and GBP/USD often move together (positive correlation).</li>
                            <li>USD/JPY and gold (XAU/USD) may move opposite (negative correlation).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>News Trading</h4>
                    <p>Trading based on economic news releases (NFP, CPI, interest rates). News can cause rapid price moves and increased volatility.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>US NFP beats expectations—USD rallies, EUR/USD drops sharply.</li>

                    <h4>Hedging</h4>
                    <p>Opening positions to offset risk in another trade. Used to protect against adverse price moves.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Buy EUR/USD and sell GBP/USD to hedge exposure to USD.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Carry Trade</h4>
                    <p>Borrowing in a low-interest currency to invest in a high-interest currency, profiting from the rate difference.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Borrow JPY (low rate), buy AUD (high rate), earn positive swap.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Exotic Pairs</h4>
                    <p>Currency pairs involving emerging market currencies (e.g., USD/KES, USD/ZAR). Higher spreads and volatility, lower liquidity.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>

                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP)</h4>
                    <p>US employment data released monthly - causes major volatility</p>
                    <p>Example: Strong NFP report can strengthen USD against other currencies</p>
                    <p><strong>Details:</strong> NFP is released on the first Friday of every month. It measures the change in the number of employed people in the US, excluding the farming industry. A higher-than-expected NFP number usually strengthens the USD, while a lower number weakens it.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Forecast: +200,000 jobs</li>
                            <li>Actual: +300,000 jobs</li>
                            <li>Result: USD rallies, EUR/USD drops as traders buy USD</li>

                    <h4>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</h4>
                    <p>Measure of inflation - affects central bank interest rate decisions</p>
                    <p>CPI tracks changes in the price of a basket of consumer goods and services. Rising CPI means inflation is increasing, which can lead central banks to raise interest rates to control inflation.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Kenya CPI rises from 110 to 115 in a year (4.5% inflation)</li>
                            <li>Central Bank may raise interest rates to curb inflation</li>
                            <li>Higher rates can strengthen the Kenyan Shilling as foreign investors seek better returns</li>
                            <li>In forex, if US CPI is higher than expected, USD may strengthen against other currencies</li>

                    <h4>Interest Rate Decisions</h4>
                    <p>Central bank rates determine currency attractiveness</p>
                    <p>Central banks (like the US Federal Reserve, ECB, or Central Bank of Kenya) set interest rates to control inflation and stimulate or slow down the economy.</p>
                    <p>Higher interest rates make a currency more attractive to investors seeking better returns, causing it to appreciate. Lower rates can weaken a currency.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>US Federal Reserve raises rates from 5% to 5.25%</li>
                            <li>USD strengthens as investors move money to USD assets for higher returns</li>
                            <li>EUR/USD drops as traders buy USD and sell EUR</li>

                    </div>

                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>GDP Growth</h4>
                    <p>Economic health indicator - stronger GDP usually strengthens currency</p>
                    <p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country. Strong GDP growth signals a healthy economy and can boost a currency's value.</p>
                    <p>Forex traders watch GDP releases for surprises that move markets.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">

                            <li>Kenya's GDP expected to grow 5%, actual growth is 7%</li>
                            <li>Kenyan Shilling may strengthen as investors gain confidence in the economy</li>
                            <li>In forex, if US GDP beats expectations, USD may rally against other currencies</li>

                <strong>Forex Example:</strong> If USD/JPY is at 110.00:
                <ul>
                    <li>Buy 1 lot (100,000 units) at 110.00</li>
                    <li>Price rises to 110.50 (50 pips gain)</li>
                    <li>Profit = 100,000 × 0.50 = ¥50,000</li>
                    <li>Convert to USD: ¥50,000 ÷ 110.50 ≈ $452.49 profit</li>

            <h2>Advanced Volume Analysis</h2>
            <p>Master reading order flow and market sentiment through volume.</p>
            <h3>Why Volume Matters</h3>
            <p>Volume is a key indicator of market strength and conviction. High volume confirms price moves, while low volume can signal weak trends or potential reversals.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a stock breaks resistance with high volume, the move is more likely to continue.</li>
                    <li>If price rises on low volume, it may be a false breakout and could reverse.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Volume Divergence</h3>
            <p>When price moves in one direction but volume does not confirm, it’s called divergence. This can warn of trend exhaustion.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Price makes new highs, but volume is decreasing &rarr; possible reversal ahead.</li>
                    <li>Price drops, but volume increases &rarr; sellers are strong, trend may continue.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Volume in Forex</h3>
            <p>Forex volume is measured by tick volume (number of price changes), since centralized volume data is unavailable. Still, spikes in tick volume often align with major news or market moves.</p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>During NFP release, EUR/USD tick volume surges, confirming volatility.</li>
                    <li>Low tick volume during Asian session signals less trading activity.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Volume Profile Example</h4>
                <p>Volume profile shows traded volume at each price level, helping identify support and resistance zones.</p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Example:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stock XYZ trades mostly between KSh 100 and KSh 105. Volume profile shows a high-volume node at KSh 102, indicating strong support.</li>
                        <li>Price breaks above KSh 105 with rising volume, suggesting buyers are in control and a new uptrend may start.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4>Accumulation/Distribution</h4>
                <p>Tracks whether volume is flowing into (accumulation) or out of (distribution) an asset.</p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Example:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accumulation: Price rises on increasing volume, indicating strong buying interest.</li>
                        <li>Distribution: Price falls on increasing volume, showing strong selling pressure.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Volume-Based Strategies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breakout Trading:</strong> Enter trades when price breaks key levels with high volume.</li>
                <li><strong>Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP):</strong> Buy below VWAP in uptrends, sell above VWAP in downtrends.</li>
                <li><strong>Volume Spikes:</strong> Watch for sudden volume increases to catch early moves.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Strategy Example:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stock consolidates at KSh 50 for days. Suddenly, volume spikes and price jumps to KSh 55. Enter long trade, set stop-loss below KSh 50.</li>
                    <li>Forex pair EUR/USD breaks resistance at 1.1000 with high tick volume. Enter buy, target next resistance at 1.1050.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Volume Breakout Example</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stock ABC trades in a tight range between KSh 80 and KSh 85 for several days.</li>
                    <li>Suddenly, volume surges and price breaks above KSh 85, reaching KSh 90.</li>
                    <li>High volume confirms the breakout; traders enter long positions targeting further upside.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Volume Fakeout Example</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forex pair USD/JPY breaks below support at 150.00 on low volume.</li>
                    <li>Price quickly reverses and moves back above 150.00 as sellers lack conviction.</li>
                    <li>Low volume warned of a possible fake breakout; traders avoid entering short.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Volume Confirmation Example</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Safaricom shares rally from KSh 20 to KSh 25 on steadily increasing volume.</li>
                    <li>Rising volume confirms strong buying interest; uptrend likely to continue.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Bid/Ask Volume</h4>
                    <p>Shows buying (at ask) vs. selling (at bid) pressure</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h4>Delta</h4>
                    <p>Difference between buying and selling volume</p>
                    <p><strong>Positive delta:</strong> More buying pressure</p>
                    <p><strong>Negative delta:</strong> More selling pressure</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If bid volume is 5,000 and ask volume is 2,000, delta = -3,000 (sellers dominate)</li>
                            <li>If ask volume is 8,000 and bid volume is 3,000, delta = +5,000 (buyers dominate)</li>

                    <h4>VWAP</h4>
                    <p>Volume Weighted Average Price - benchmark for institutional trading</p>
                    <p>VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) is calculated by taking the total value traded (price × volume) and dividing by total volume. It helps traders see the average price at which a security has traded throughout the day, weighted by volume.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>VWAP Calculation Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Trade 1: 100 shares at KSh 20 = KSh 2,000</li>
                            <li>Trade 2: 200 shares at KSh 21 = KSh 4,200</li>
                            <li>Trade 3: 150 shares at KSh 22 = KSh 3,300</li>
                            <li>Total shares traded = 100 + 200 + 150 = 450</li>
                            <li>Total value traded = KSh 2,000 + KSh 4,200 + KSh 3,300 = KSh 9,500</li>
                            <li>VWAP = KSh 9,500 / 450 = KSh 21.11</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If price is above VWAP, buyers are in control; if below, sellers dominate. Institutions often use VWAP to execute large orders without moving the market.</p>

                    <h4>Volume Spikes</h4>
                    <p>Unusual trading activity often precedes big moves</p>
                    <p>Volume spikes are sudden, significant increases in trading volume that often precede major price moves. They can signal the start of a new trend, a reversal, or the presence of institutional activity.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Volume Spike Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stock XYZ typically trades 10,000 shares per day. Suddenly, volume jumps to 100,000 shares as price breaks resistance. This spike suggests strong buying interest and a potential uptrend.</li>
                            <li>Forex pair EUR/USD averages 50,000 tick volume per hour. During a major news release, tick volume surges to 200,000, confirming increased volatility and a possible breakout.</li>
                            <li>Safaricom shares trade flat for weeks, then volume triples as price rallies. The volume spike confirms institutional buying and a new bullish phase.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Traders use volume spikes to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify breakout opportunities</li>
                        <li>Confirm the strength of price moves</li>
                        <li>Spot potential reversals when volume spikes occur at key support/resistance levels</li>
                        <li>Detect institutional activity (large players entering or exiting positions)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>How to Trade Volume Spikes:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wait for price to break a key level (support/resistance) with a volume spike</li>
                            <li>Enter the trade in the direction of the breakout</li>
                            <li>Set stop-loss just below/above the breakout level to manage risk</li>
                            <li>Use volume indicators (e.g., On-Balance Volume, Volume Oscillator) to confirm signals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Remember: Not all volume spikes lead to sustained moves. Always confirm with price action and other indicators before entering trades.</p>

                <h4>Footprint Chart Example</h4>
                <p>Footprint charts display the volume traded at each price level, split between buyers and sellers. They help traders see where large trades occurred and which side (buy or sell) dominated at specific prices.</p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Example:</strong>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        At KSh 100.00, buyers dominate (green), suggesting strong support.<br>
                        At KSh 100.50, sellers dominate (red), indicating resistance.<br>
                        At KSh 101.00, a surge in buy volume signals a breakout.

                <ul>
                    <li>Identify price levels with high buy or sell volume to spot support/resistance zones.</li>
                    <li>Look for imbalances (e.g., much higher buy than sell volume) to anticipate breakouts or reversals.</li>
                    <li>Combine with price action and other indicators for confirmation.</li>
                </ul>

                        <li><strong>Scalping:</strong> Traders use DOM to enter/exit quickly, profiting from small price moves and order flow changes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Support/Resistance:</strong> Identify price levels with stacked orders to find potential reversal or breakout zones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Absorption:</strong> Watch for large orders absorbing market pressure—if buyers keep absorbing sell orders, price may eventually break higher.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>DOM Strategy Example:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stock XYZ has a large buy wall at KSh 50 (5,000 shares). Price dips to KSh 50 but rebounds as buyers absorb all sell orders—enter long trade.</li>
                            <li>Forex pair USD/JPY shows a fake sell wall at 150.00 (10,000 units), but price quickly moves above as wall disappears—avoid shorting, look for breakout.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>DOM Visualization Tools:</strong> Modern trading platforms offer DOM windows showing real-time order book depth. Use these to monitor liquidity, spot large orders, and time entries/exits.

                    <h4>ARIMA</h4>
                    <p>AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average - time series forecasting model</p>
                    <p>ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a powerful statistical model used for forecasting time series data, such as stock prices, exchange rates, or economic indicators. It combines three components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>AR (AutoRegressive):</strong> Uses past values to predict future values.</li>
                        <li><strong>I (Integrated):</strong> Differencing the data to make it stationary (removing trends).</li>
                        <li><strong>MA (Moving Average):</strong> Models the error of predictions as a combination of past errors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>How ARIMA Works:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Identify if the time series is stationary (constant mean/variance). If not, difference the data.</li>
                        <li>Select AR and MA orders (how many past values/errors to use).</li>
                        <li>Fit the ARIMA model to historical data.</li>
                        <li>Use the model to forecast future values.</li>
                    </ol>

                            <li>Forecasting Safaricom stock price for the next 7 days using historical closing prices.</li>
                            <li>Predicting USD/KES exchange rate trends for risk management.</li>
                            <li>Estimating future sales or revenue for budgeting.</li>

                    # Load historical Safaricom prices (example data)
                    data = pd.read_csv('safaricom_prices.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)
                    prices = data['Close']

                    # Fit ARIMA model (order p=1, d=1, q=1)
                    model = ARIMA(prices, order=(1,1,1))

                    <h4>GARCH</h4>
                    <p>Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity - models volatility clustering in financial time series</p>
                    <p>The GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model is a statistical tool used to estimate and forecast financial market volatility. Unlike basic models that assume constant volatility, GARCH captures "volatility clustering"—periods when markets are more or less volatile over time.</p>

                        <li><strong>How GARCH Works:</strong>

                                <li>Analyzes past returns and past volatility to predict future volatility.</li>
                                <li>Models periods of high and low volatility, which is common in financial markets.</li>
                                <li>Widely used for risk management, option pricing, and trading strategies.</li>

                                    <li>Helps set stop-loss levels, position sizing, and price options more accurately.</li>
                                    <li>Risk managers use GARCH to estimate Value at Risk (VaR) for portfolios.</li>
